## CLASH ROYAL ASSITANT

This program shows the oppenents elixer and card cycle to assit the player in games

# How to use

Enter the card that was played using the keyboard shortcuts found in cards.py

If the card was all ready played keys 1,2,3,4 should be used to indicate which card was playe

Tab can be pressed to rotate the cycle backwards to undo a mistake

# Poblems

The undo action ca only be used with number keys, not if the card was entered through the keyboad

When a card is played in the game the elixer bar freezes for an amount of time, the program does not incorperate this

# For the future

Fix problems

Use machine learning to automaticly enter the cards played

## CLASH ROYAL ASSITANT

This program shows the oppenents elixer and card cycle to assit the player in games

# How to use

Start the program when the game starts

Enter the card that was played using the keyboard shortcuts found in cards.py and press either enter or space

If the card was all ready played keys 1,2,3,4 should be used to indicate which card was played

Tab can be pressed to rotate the cycle backwards to undo a mistake

# Poblems

When undoing a card the funtion adds the seconds lost back to the calcElixer funtion but becasue as soon as the the time is above 2.8 it adds a new elixer so it can only account for one elixer lost

Add new cards

# For the future

Fix problems

Use object detection to automaticly enter the cards played
